        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Amin, a Master of Management student based in Wellington. 
            I’m all about combining curiosity, creativity, and a drive to make a difference—whether it’s in business, 
            research, or helping others.</p>
        <p>Right now, I work as a Research Assistant at MarketResearcher.ai, while completing my Master of Management degree in Wellington. 
            My work revolves around market analysis, assisting businesses uncover opportunities, and turning ideas into actionable plans. </p>
        <p>When I’m not working, I volunteer with Red Cross New Zealand, supporting vulnerable communities. 
            I’m also a researcher in the field of energy science, 
            with publications focusing on tackling energy-related hardships for those who need it most. </p>
        <p>My hobbies are hitting the gym and studying Japanese to stay fluent.
        <p>And in my free time? 
            I love learning new things—like building this website from scratch with absolutely no experience (and having fun along the way!). </p>
