        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Amin, a Master of Management student based in Wellington. 
            I’m all about combining curiosity, creativity, and a drive to make a difference—whether it’s in business, 
            research, or helping others.</p>
        <p>Right now, I work as an R&D Specialist at Market Researcher, while completing my Master of Management degree in Wellington. 
            My work revolves around market analysis, assisting businesses uncover new opportunities, and turning ideas into actionable plans. </p>
        <p>When I’m not working, I volunteer with Red Cross New Zealand, supporting vulnerable communities in Kāpiti coast. 
            I’m also a researcher in the field of energy science, 
            with publications focused on addressing energy-related hardships faced by vulnerable communities. </p>
        <p>My hobbies are hitting the gym and studying Japanese to stay fluent.</p>
        <p>And in my free time? 
            I love learning new things! like building this website from scratch with absolutely no experience (and having fun with new challenges!). </p>
